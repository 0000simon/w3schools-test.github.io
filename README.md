# Guestbook for w3schools.com Git tutorial

This is the public GitHub project that you can contribute to.
If you are just getting started, I suggest you start at the tutorial here: https://www.w3schools.com/git

# Leave a message for us!
This repository is meant to be a place where our users can leave messages for others to see.

You can see the result here: https://w3schools-test.github.io/

We generally only have one condition: 
We will not allow messages that are negative, or hurtful. Try to be welcome and positive!

# What should my message look like?

You can add almost anything to the index.html file between the indicated comments:

`<!-- Insert your message below here -->`

<div class="w3-panel w3-light-grey">
  <span style="font-size:150px;line-height:0.6em;opacity:0.2">&#10077;</span>
  <p class="w3-xlarge" style="margin-top:-40px">
  <i>"感谢w3schools"</i></p>
  <p>Verolls 2022/06/14 from China</p>
</div>

`<!-- End user messages -->`

So feel free to use your imagination!

If you are not feeling very creative, you can add a quote, or small text like the examples on this page: https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_quotes.asp
And add your name to it :)
